# Task 1 Software configuration

## Subtask1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

This project is a super opportunity to get chance to be noticed. Offers for QA have falt the most on IT market, and in addition to the fact that we will receive new knowledges, also we will have a chance to be invited to a work. The last is my goal exactly)
